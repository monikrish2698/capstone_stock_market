## Introduction

In the post-COVID-19 era, retail participation in stock markets globally, and specifically in India, has surged significantly. However, this increased participation has revealed concerning trends—up to 95% of retail traders lose money due to impulsive decisions, reliance on unverified tips, and inadequate foundational understanding of financial metrics.

The primary goal of this capstone project is to create an interactive, beginner-friendly dashboard designed specifically to educate novice traders, improving their understanding of stock market fundamentals and reducing uninformed trading practices.

## Rationale for Using U.S. Stock Data

For this Proof of Concept (POC), data from the U.S. stock markets is utilized due to:

- **Availability:** Extensive APIs, particularly from Polygon.io, offer rich, granular historical and near-real-time datasets.
- **Data Richness:** The comprehensive nature of U.S. stock market data, including historical OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) prices, trading volume data, and corporate actions such as stock splits, exceeds the availability and granularity found in Indian market datasets.
- **Standardization and Documentation:** Well-documented and standardized APIs facilitate initial development and validation.

## Educational Outcome Emphasis

This dashboard explicitly targets novice traders with educational goals:

- **Data Literacy:** Teaching fundamental metrics such as volatility, moving averages, and valuation ratios.
- **Self-awareness & Discipline:** Encouraging users to analyze patterns and historical trends, promoting informed observation over impulsive decisions.
- **Risk Awareness:** Providing clear visualizations and interactive elements that build understanding of market dynamics, risk metrics, and sentiment analysis.
  
It must be emphasized that the platform does not provide direct financial advice nor encourages immediate trading decisions. The objective is purely educational, designed to enhance traders’ analytical skills and knowledge.

## Data Sources

**Polygon.io API:** Offers comprehensive historical data, OHLC, trading volume, splits ratio, and news feeds, crucial for both data analysis and visualization.
